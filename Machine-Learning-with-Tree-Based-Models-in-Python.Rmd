**Course Description**

<p class="course__description">Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions.
In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library. You'll understand the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets. Finally, you'll also understand how to tune the most influential hyperparameters in order to get the most out of your models.</p>

### Classification and Regression {.unnumbered}

<p class="chapter__description">
    Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are a set of supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the CART algorithm.

#### Decision tree for classification {.unnumbered}



##### Train your first classification tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise you'll work with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data">Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset</a> from the UCI machine learning repository. You'll predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on two features: the mean radius of the tumor (<code>radius_mean</code>) and its mean number of concave points (<code>concave points_mean</code>).</p>
<p>The dataset is already loaded in your workspace and is split into 80% train and 20% test. The feature matrices are assigned to <code>X_train</code> and <code>X_test</code>, while the arrays of labels are assigned to <code>y_train</code> and <code>y_test</code> where class 1 corresponds to a malignant tumor and class 0 corresponds to a benign tumor. To obtain reproducible results, we also defined a variable called <code>SEED</code> which is set to 1.</p>
</div>




<li>Import <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.tree</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> <code>dt</code> of maximum depth equal to 6. </li>

<li>Fit <code>dt</code> to the training set.</li>

<li>Predict the test set labels and assign the result to <code>y_pred</code>.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv('archive/Machine-Learning-with-Tree-Based-Models-in-Python/datasets/wbc.csv')
label_encoder = sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
label_encoder.fit(df['diagnosis'])
X= df[['radius_mean', 'concave points_mean']]
y = label_encoder.transform(df['diagnosis'])
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(X,y)
SEED = 1

# Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Instantiate a DecisionTreeClassifier 'dt' with a maximum depth of 6
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=6, random_state=SEED)

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)
print(y_pred[0:5])
```

<p class="">Awesome! You've just trained your first classification tree! You can see the first five predictions made by the fitted tree on the test set in the console. In the next exercise, you'll evaluate the tree's performance on the entire test set.</p>

##### Evaluate the classification tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now that you've fit your first classification tree, it's time to evaluate its performance on the test set. You'll do so using the accuracy metric which corresponds to the fraction of correct predictions made on the test set.</p>
<p>The trained model <code>dt</code> from the previous exercise is loaded in your workspace along with the test set features matrix <code>X_test</code> and the array of labels <code>y_test</code>.</p>
</div>

<li>Import the function <code>accuracy_score</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</li>

<li>Predict the test set labels and assign the obtained array to <code>y_pred</code>.</li>

<li>Evaluate the test set accuracy score of <code>dt</code> by calling <code>accuracy_score()</code> and assign the value to <code>acc</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

# Compute test set accuracy  
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Test set accuracy: {:.2f}".format(acc))
```

<p class="">Not bad! Using only two features, your tree was able to achieve an accuracy of 89%!</p>

##### Logistic regression vs classification tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>A classification tree divides the feature space into <strong>rectangular regions</strong>. In contrast, a linear model such as logistic regression produces only a single linear decision boundary dividing the feature space into two decision regions.</p>
<p>We have written a custom function called <code>plot_labeled_decision_regions()</code> that you can use to plot the decision regions of a list containing two trained classifiers. You can type <code>help(plot_labeled_decision_regions)</code> in the IPython shell to learn more about this function. </p>
<p><code>X_train</code>, <code>X_test</code>, <code>y_train</code>, <code>y_test</code>, the model <code>dt</code> that you've trained in an earlier <a href="https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python/classification-and-regression-trees?ex=2">exercise</a> , as well as the function <code>plot_labeled_decision_regions()</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>


<li>Import  <code>LogisticRegression</code> from <code>sklearn.linear_model</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>LogisticRegression</code> model and assign it to <code>logreg</code>.</li>

<li>Fit <code>logreg</code> to the training set.</li>

<li>Review the plot generated by <code>plot_labeled_decision_regions()</code>.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
import mlxtend.plotting

def plot_labeled_decision_regions(X_test, y_test, clfs):
    
    for clf in clfs:

        mlxtend.plotting.plot_decision_regions(np.array(X_test), np.array(y_test), clf=clf, legend=2)
        
        plt.ylim((0,0.2))

        # Adding axes annotations
        plt.xlabel(X_cols[0])
        plt.ylabel(X_cols[1])
        plt.title(str(clf).split('(')[0])
        plt.show()
        
X_cols = df[['radius_mean','concave points_mean']].columns

# Import LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Instatiate logreg
logreg = LogisticRegression(random_state=1)

# Fit logreg to the training set
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

import numpy as np
# Define a list called clfs containing the two classifiers logreg and dt
clfs = [logreg, dt]

# Review the decision regions of the two classifiers
plot_labeled_decision_regions(X_test, y_test, clfs)
```

<p class="">Great work! Notice how the decision boundary produced by logistic regression is linear while the boundaries produced by the classification tree divide the feature space into rectangular regions.</p>

#### Classification tree Learning {.unnumbered}



##### Growing a classification tree {.unnumbered}

<p>In the video, you saw that the growth of an unconstrained classification tree followed a few simple rules. Which of the following is <strong>not</strong> one of these rules?</p>


- [ ] The existence of a node depends on the state of its predecessors.
- [ ] The impurity of a node can be determined using different criteria such as entropy and the gini-index.
- [ ] When the information gain resulting from splitting a node is null, the node is declared as a leaf.
- [x] When an internal node is split, the split is performed in such a way so that information gain is minimized.


<p class="dc-completion-pane__message dc-u-maxw-100pc">Absolutely so! It's quite the contrary! Actually, splitting an internal node always involves maximizing information gain!</p>

##### Using entropy as a criterion {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll train a classification tree on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using entropy as an information criterion. You'll do so using all the 30 features in the dataset, which is split into 80% train and 20% test.</p>
<p><code>X_train</code> as well as the array of labels <code>y_train</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.tree</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> <code>dt_entropy</code> with a maximum depth of 8.</li>

<li>Set the information criterion to <code>'entropy'</code>. </li>

<li>Fit <code>dt_entropy</code> on the training set.</li>
```{python}
# Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Instantiate dt_entropy, set 'entropy' as the information criterion
dt_entropy = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=8, criterion='entropy', random_state=1)
dt_gini = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=8, criterion='gini', random_state=1)

# Fit dt_entropy to the training set
dt_entropy.fit(X_train, y_train)
dt_gini.fit(X_train,y_train)
```

<p class="">Wonderful! In the next exercise, you'll compare the accuracy of <code>dt_entropy</code> to the accuracy of a another tree trained using the gini-index as the information criterion.</p>

##### Entropy vs Gini index {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise you'll compare the test set accuracy of <code>dt_entropy</code> to the accuracy of another tree named <code>dt_gini</code>. The tree <code>dt_gini</code> was trained on the same dataset using the same parameters except for the information criterion which was set to the gini index using the keyword <code>'gini'</code>.</p>
<p><code>X_test</code>, <code>y_test</code>, <code>dt_entropy</code>, as well as <code>accuracy_gini</code> which corresponds to the test set accuracy achieved by <code>dt_gini</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>accuracy_score</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</li>

<li>Predict the test set labels of <code>dt_entropy</code> and assign the result to <code>y_pred</code>.</li>

<li>Evaluate the test set accuracy of <code>dt_entropy</code> and assign the result to <code>accuracy_entropy</code>.</li>

<li>Review <code>accuracy_entropy</code> and <code>accuracy_gini</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Use dt_entropy to predict test set labels
y_pred = dt_entropy.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy_entropy
accuracy_entropy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
accuracy_gini = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print accuracy_entropy
print('Accuracy achieved by using entropy: ', accuracy_entropy)
# Print accuracy_gini
print('Accuracy achieved by using the gini index: ', accuracy_gini)
```

<p class="">Nice work!  Notice how the two models achieve almost the same accuracy. Most of the time, the gini index and entropy lead to the same results. The gini index is slightly faster to compute and is the default criterion used in the <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> model of scikit-learn.</p>

#### Decision tree for regression {.unnumbered}



##### Train your first regression tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll train a regression tree to predict the <code>mpg</code> (miles per gallon) consumption of cars in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset">auto-mpg dataset</a> using all the six available features.</p>
<p>The dataset is processed for you and is split to 80% train and 20% test. The features matrix <code>X_train</code> and the array <code>y_train</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>



<li>Import <code>DecisionTreeRegressor</code>  from <code>sklearn.tree</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a  <code>DecisionTreeRegressor</code> <code>dt</code> with maximum depth 8 and <code>min_samples_leaf</code> set to 0.13.</li>

<li>Fit <code>dt</code> to the training set.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
df = pd.read_csv('archive/Machine-Learning-with-Tree-Based-Models-in-Python/datasets/auto.csv')
X = df[['displ', 'hp', 'weight', 'accel', 'size', 'origin']]
X = X.drop(columns = 'origin').reset_index(drop=True)
OneHotEncoder = OneHotEncoder()
OneHotEncodings = OneHotEncoder.fit_transform(df[['origin']]).toarray()
OneHotEncodings = pd.DataFrame(OneHotEncodings, columns = ['origin_'+header for header in OneHotEncoder.categories_[0]])
X = pd.concat((X,OneHotEncodings),axis=1)
y = df['mpg']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=1)

# Import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=8,
             min_samples_leaf=0.13,
            random_state=3)
            
# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

<p class="">Great work! In the next exercise, you'll evaluate <code>dt</code>'s performance on the test set.</p>

##### Evaluate the regression tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you will evaluate the test set performance of <code>dt</code> using the  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The RMSE of a model measures, on average, how much the model's predictions differ from the actual labels. The RMSE of a model can be obtained by computing the square root of the model's Mean Squared Error (MSE).</p>
<p>The features matrix <code>X_test</code>, the array <code>y_test</code>, as well as the decision tree regressor <code>dt</code> that you trained in the previous exercise are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>

<li>Import the function <code>mean_squared_error</code> as <code>MSE</code>  from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</li>

<li>Predict the test set labels and assign the output to <code>y_pred</code>.</li>

<li>Compute the test set MSE by calling <code>MSE</code> and assign the result to <code>mse_dt</code>.</li>

<li>Compute the test set RMSE and assign it to <code>rmse_dt</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Compute y_pred
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

# Compute mse_dt
mse_dt = MSE(y_test, y_pred)

# Compute rmse_dt
rmse_dt = mse_dt**(1/2)

# Print rmse_dt
print("Test set RMSE of dt: {:.2f}".format(rmse_dt))
```

<p class="">Great work! In the next exercise, you'll compare the test-set RMSE of <code>dt</code> to that of a linear regression model trained on the same dataset.</p>

##### Linear regression vs regression tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll compare the test set RMSE of <code>dt</code> to that achieved by a linear regression model. We have already instantiated a linear regression model <code>lr</code> and trained it on the same dataset as <code>dt</code>. </p>
<p>The features matrix <code>X_test</code>, the array of labels  <code>y_test</code>, the trained linear regression model <code>lr</code>, <code>mean_squared_error</code> function which was imported under the alias <code>MSE</code> and <code>rmse_dt</code> from the previous exercise are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>


<li>Predict test set labels using the linear regression model (<code>lr</code>) and assign the result to <code>y_pred_lr</code>.</li>

<li>Compute the test set MSE and assign the result to <code>mse_lr</code>. </li>

<li>Compute the test set RMSE and assign the result to <code>rmse_lr</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=1)

# Create the regressor: reg_all
lr = LinearRegression()

# Fit the regressor to the training data
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels 
y_pred_lr = lr.predict(X_test)

# Compute mse_lr
mse_lr = MSE(y_test, y_pred_lr)

# Compute rmse_lr
rmse_lr = mse_lr**(1/2)

# Print rmse_lr
print('Linear Regression test set RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(rmse_lr))

# Print rmse_dt
print('Regression Tree test set RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(rmse_dt))
```

<p class="">Awesome! You're on your way to master decision trees.</p>

##### Overfitting and underfitting {.unnumbered}

<p class="dc-completion-pane__message dc-u-maxw-100pc">Absolutely! Model B is not able to capture the nonlinear dependence of <code>mpg</code> on <code>displ</code>.</p>

#### Bias & variance {.unnumbered}



##### Instantiate the model {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In the following set of exercises, you'll diagnose the bias and variance problems of a regression tree. The regression tree you'll define in this exercise will be used to predict the mpg consumption of cars from the auto dataset using all available features.</p>
<p>We have already processed the data and loaded the features matrix <code>X</code> and the array <code>y</code> in your workspace. In addition, the <code>DecisionTreeRegressor</code> class was imported from <code>sklearn.tree</code>.</p>
</div>


<li>Import <code>train_test_split</code> from <code>sklearn.model_selection</code>.</li>

<li>Split the data into 70% train and 30% test. </li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>DecisionTreeRegressor</code> with max depth 4 and <code>min_samples_leaf</code> set to 0.26.</li>
```{python}
# Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Set SEED for reproducibility
SEED = 1

# Split the data into 70% train and 30% test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.30, random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate a DecisionTreeRegressor dt
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=4, min_samples_leaf=0.26, random_state=SEED)
```

<p class="">Great work! In the next exercise, you'll evaluate <code>dt</code>'s CV error.</p>

##### Evaluate the 10-fold CV error {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll evaluate the 10-fold CV Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) achieved by the regression tree <code>dt</code> that you instantiated in the previous exercise.</p>
<p>In addition to <code>dt</code>, the training data including <code>X_train</code> and <code>y_train</code> are available in your workspace. We also imported <code>cross_val_score</code> from <code>sklearn.model_selection</code>.</p>
<p>Note that since <code>cross_val_score</code> has only the option of evaluating the negative MSEs, its output should be multiplied by negative one to obtain the MSEs. The CV RMSE can then be obtained by computing the square root of the average MSE.</p>
</div>

<li>Compute <code>dt</code>'s 10-fold cross-validated MSE by setting the <code>scoring</code> argument to <code>'neg_mean_squared_error'</code>.</li>

<li>Compute RMSE from the obtained MSE scores.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Compute the array containing the 10-folds CV MSEs
MSE_CV_scores = - cross_val_score(dt, X_train, y_train, cv=10, 
                                  scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', 
                                  n_jobs=-1) 
                                  
# Compute the 10-folds CV RMSE
RMSE_CV = (MSE_CV_scores.mean())**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_CV
print('CV RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_CV))
```

<p class="">Great work! A very good practice is to keep the test set untouched until you are confident about your model's performance. CV is a great technique to get an estimate of a model's performance without affecting the test set.</p>

##### Evaluate the training error {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>You'll now evaluate the training set RMSE achieved by the regression tree <code>dt</code> that you instantiated in a previous exercise.</p>
<p>In addition to <code>dt</code>, <code>X_train</code> and <code>y_train</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
<p>Note that in scikit-learn, the MSE of a model can be computed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>MSE_model = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_predicted)
</code></pre>
<p>where we use the function <code>mean_squared_error</code> from the <code>metrics</code> module and pass it the true labels <code>y_true</code> as a first argument, and the predicted labels from the model <code>y_predicted</code> as a second argument.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>mean_squared_error</code> as <code>MSE</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</li>

<li>Fit <code>dt</code> to the training set.</li>

<li>Predict <code>dt</code>'s training set labels and assign the result to <code>y_pred_train</code>. </li>

<li>Evaluate <code>dt</code>'s training set RMSE and assign it to <code>RMSE_train</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the training set
y_pred_train = dt.predict(X_train)

# Evaluate the training set RMSE of dt
RMSE_train = (MSE(y_train, y_pred_train))**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_train
print('Train RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_train))
```

<p class="">Awesome! Notice how the training error is roughly equal to the 10-folds CV error you obtained in the previous exercise.</p>

##### High bias or high variance? {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise you'll diagnose whether the regression tree <code>dt</code> you trained in the previous exercise suffers from a bias or a variance problem. </p>
<p>The training set RMSE (<code>RMSE_train</code>) and the CV RMSE (<code>RMSE_CV</code>) achieved by <code>dt</code> are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded a variable called <code>baseline_RMSE</code> which corresponds to the root mean-squared error achieved by the regression-tree trained with the <code>disp</code> feature only (it is the RMSE achieved by the regression tree trained in chapter 1, lesson 3). Here <code>baseline_RMSE</code> serves as the baseline RMSE above which a model is considered to be underfitting and below which the model is considered 'good enough'.</p>
<p>Does <code>dt</code> suffer from a high bias or a high variance problem?</p>
</div>


- [ ] <code>dt</code> suffers from high variance because <code>RMSE_CV</code> is far less than <code>RMSE_train</code>.
- [x] <code>dt</code> suffers from  high bias because <code>RMSE_CV</code> <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" role="presentation" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="16" style="font-size: 116.7%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2248"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml role="presentation" unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>≈</mo></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> <code>RMSE_train</code> and both scores are greater than <code>baseline_RMSE</code>.
- [ ] <code>dt</code> is a good fit because <code>RMSE_CV</code> <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" role="presentation" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="17" style="font-size: 116.7%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2248"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml role="presentation" unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mo>≈</mo></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> <code>RMSE_train</code> and both scores are smaller than <code>baseline_RMSE</code>.

<p class="">Correct! <code>dt</code> is indeed underfitting the training set as the model is too constrained to capture the nonlinear dependencies between features and labels.</p>

#### Ensemble Learning {.unnumbered}



##### Define the ensemble {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In the following set of exercises, you'll work with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jeevannagaraj/indian-liver-patient-dataset">Indian Liver Patient Dataset</a> from the UCI Machine learning repository. </p>
<p>In this exercise, you'll instantiate three classifiers to predict whether a patient suffers from a liver disease using all the features present in the dataset. </p>
<p>The classes <code>LogisticRegression</code>, <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code>, and <code>KNeighborsClassifier</code> under the alias <code>KNN</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>


<li>Instantiate a Logistic Regression classifier and assign it to <code>lr</code>. </li>

<li>Instantiate a KNN classifier that considers 27 nearest neighbors and assign it to <code>knn</code>. </li>

<li>Instantiate a Decision Tree Classifier with the parameter <code>min_samples_leaf</code> set to 0.13 and assign it to <code>dt</code>.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
df = pd.read_csv("archive/Machine-Learning-with-Tree-Based-Models-in-Python/datasets/indian_liver_patient_preprocessed.csv")
X = df.drop(columns = ['Liver_disease'])
y = df['Liver_disease']
X_train, X_test,  y_train, y_test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(X,y)
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Set seed for reproducibility
SEED=1

# Instantiate lr
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=27)

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=.13, random_state=SEED)

# Define the list classifiers
classifiers = [('Logistic Regression', lr), ('K Nearest Neighbours', knn), ('Classification Tree', dt)]
```

<p class="">Great! In the next exercise, you will train these classifiers and evaluate their test set accuracy.</p>

##### Evaluate individual classifiers {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise you'll evaluate the performance of the models in the list <code>classifiers</code> that we defined in the previous exercise. You'll do so by fitting each classifier on the training set and evaluating its test set accuracy.</p>
<p>The dataset is already loaded and preprocessed for you (numerical features are standardized) and it is split into 70% train and 30% test. The features matrices <code>X_train</code> and <code>X_test</code>, as well as the arrays of labels <code>y_train</code> and <code>y_test</code> are available in your workspace. In addition, we have loaded the list <code>classifiers</code> from the previous exercise, as well as the function <code>accuracy_score()</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</p>
</div>


<li>Iterate over the tuples in <code>classifiers</code>. Use <code>clf_name</code> and <code>clf</code> as the <code>for</code> loop variables:
<li>Fit <code>clf</code> to the training set.</li>

<li>Predict <code>clf</code>'s test set labels and assign the results to <code>y_pred</code>.</li>

<li>Evaluate the test set accuracy of <code>clf</code> and print the result.</li>


</li>
```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Iterate over the pre-defined list of classifiers
for clf_name, clf in classifiers:    
 
    # Fit clf to the training set
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)    
   
    # Predict y_pred
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) 
   
    # Evaluate clf's accuracy on the test set
    print('{:s} : {:.3f}'.format(clf_name, accuracy))
```

<p class="">Great work! Notice how Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 74.1%.</p>

##### Better performance with a Voting Classifier {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Finally, you'll evaluate the performance of a voting classifier that takes the outputs of the models defined in the list <code>classifiers</code> and assigns labels by majority voting.  </p>
<p><code>X_train</code>, <code>X_test</code>,<code>y_train</code>, <code>y_test</code>, the list <code>classifiers</code> defined in a previous exercise, as well as the function <code>accuracy_score</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>VotingClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.ensemble</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>VotingClassifier</code> by setting the parameter <code>estimators</code> to <code>classifiers</code> and assign it to <code>vc</code>. </li>

<li>Fit <code>vc</code> to the training set.</li>
```{python}
 
```
<li>Evaluate <code>vc</code>'s test set accuracy using the test set predictions <code>y_pred</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import VotingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

# Instantiate a VotingClassifier vc
vc = VotingClassifier(estimators=classifiers)

# Fit vc to the training set
vc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the test set predictions
y_pred = vc.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Voting Classifier: {:.3f}'.format(accuracy))
```

<p class="">Great work! Notice how the voting classifier achieves a test set accuracy of 76.4%. This value is greater than that achieved by <code>LogisticRegression</code>.</p>

### Bagging and Random Forests {.unnumbered}

<p class="chapter__description">
    Bagging is an ensemble method involving training the same algorithm many times using different subsets sampled from the training data. In this chapter, you'll understand how bagging can be used to create a tree ensemble. You'll also learn how the random forests algorithm can lead to further ensemble diversity through randomization at the level of each split in the trees forming the ensemble.
  </p>

#### Bagging {.unnumbered}



##### Define the bagging classifier {.unnumbered}


<div class><p>In the following exercises you'll work with the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records">Indian Liver Patient</a> dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. Your task is to predict whether a patient suffers from a liver disease using 10 features including Albumin, age and gender. You'll do so using a Bagging Classifier.</p></div>

<li>Import <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.tree</code> and <code>BaggingClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.ensemble</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> called <code>dt</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>BaggingClassifier</code> called <code>bc</code> consisting of 50 trees.</li>
```{python}
# Import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=1)

# Instantiate bc
bc = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=dt, n_estimators=50, random_state=1)
```

<p class="">Great! In the following exercise, you'll train <code>bc</code> and evaluate its test set performance.</p>

##### Evaluate Bagging performance {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now that you instantiated the bagging classifier, it's time to train it and evaluate its test set accuracy. </p>
<p>The Indian Liver Patient dataset is processed for you and split into 80% train and 20% test. The feature matrices <code>X_train</code> and <code>X_test</code>, as well as the arrays of labels <code>y_train</code> and <code>y_test</code> are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded the bagging classifier <code>bc</code> that you instantiated in the previous exercise and the function <code>accuracy_score()</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</p>
</div>

<li>Fit <code>bc</code> to the training set.</li>

<li>Predict the test set labels and assign the result to <code>y_pred</code>.</li>

<li>Determine <code>bc</code>'s test set accuracy.</li>
```{python}
# Fit bc to the training set
bc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = bc.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate acc_test
acc_test = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Test set accuracy of bc: {:.2f}'.format(acc_test)) 
```

<p class="">Great work! A single tree <code>dt</code> would have achieved an accuracy of 63% which is 4% lower than <code>bc</code>'s accuracy!</p>

#### Out of Bag Evaluation {.unnumbered}



##### Prepare the ground {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In the following exercises, you'll compare the OOB accuracy to the test set accuracy of a bagging classifier trained on the Indian Liver Patient dataset. </p>
<p>In sklearn, you can evaluate the OOB accuracy of an ensemble classifier by setting the parameter <code>oob_score</code> to <code>True</code> during instantiation. After training the classifier, the OOB accuracy can be obtained by accessing the <code>.oob_score_</code> attribute from the corresponding instance.</p>
<p>In your environment, we have made available the class <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.tree</code>.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>BaggingClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.ensemble</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> with <code>min_samples_leaf</code> set to 8.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>BaggingClassifier</code> consisting of 50 trees and set <code>oob_score</code> to <code>True</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=8, random_state=1)

# Instantiate bc
bc = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=dt, 
            n_estimators=50,
            oob_score=True,
            random_state=1)
```

<p class="">Great! In the following exercise, you'll train <code>bc</code> and compare its test set accuracy to its OOB accuracy.</p>

##### OOB Score vs Test Set Score {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now that you instantiated <code>bc</code>, you will fit it to the training set and evaluate its test set and OOB accuracies. </p>
<p>The dataset is processed for you and split into 80% train and 20% test. The feature matrices <code>X_train</code> and <code>X_test</code>, as well as the arrays of labels <code>y_train</code> and <code>y_test</code> are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded the classifier <code>bc</code> instantiated in the previous exercise and the function <code>accuracy_score()</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</p>
</div>

<li>Fit <code>bc</code> to the training set and predict the test set labels and assign the results to <code>y_pred</code>.</li>

<li>Evaluate the test set accuracy <code>acc_test</code> by calling <code>accuracy_score</code>.</li>

<li>Evaluate <code>bc</code>'s OOB accuracy <code>acc_oob</code> by extracting the attribute <code>oob_score_</code> from <code>bc</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Fit bc to the training set 
bc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = bc.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate test set accuracy
acc_test = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Evaluate OOB accuracy
acc_oob = bc.oob_score_

# Print acc_test and acc_oob
print('Test set accuracy: {:.3f}, OOB accuracy: {:.3f}'.format(acc_test, acc_oob))
```

<p class="">Great work! The test set accuracy and the OOB accuracy of <code>bc</code> are both roughly equal to 70%!</p>

#### Random Forests (RF) {.unnumbered}



##### Train an RF regressor {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In the following exercises you'll predict bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C using historical weather data from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand">Bike Sharing Demand</a> dataset available through Kaggle. For this purpose, you will be using the random forests algorithm. As a first step, you'll define a random forests regressor and fit it to the training set.</p>
<p>The dataset is processed for you and split into 80% train and 20% test. The features matrix <code>X_train</code> and the array <code>y_train</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>RandomForestRegressor</code> from <code>sklearn.ensemble</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>RandomForestRegressor</code> called <code>rf</code> consisting of 25 trees.  </li>

<li>Fit <code>rf</code> to the training set.</li>
```{python}
# Import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Instantiate rf
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=25,
            random_state=2)
            
# Fit rf to the training set    
rf.fit(X_train, y_train) 
```

<p class="">Great work! Next comes the test set RMSE evaluation part.</p>

##### Evaluate the RF regressor {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>You'll now evaluate the test set RMSE of the random forests regressor <code>rf</code> that you trained in the previous exercise. </p>
<p>The dataset is processed for you and split into 80% train and 20% test. The features matrix <code>X_test</code>, as well as the array <code>y_test</code> are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded the model <code>rf</code> that you trained in the previous exercise.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>mean_squared_error</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code> as <code>MSE</code>. </li>

<li>Predict the test set labels and assign the result to <code>y_pred</code>.  </li>

<li>Compute the test set RMSE and assign it to <code>rmse_test</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import mean_squared_error as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Predict the test set labels
y_pred = rf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the test set RMSE
rmse_test = MSE(y_test,y_pred)**0.5

# Print rmse_test
print('Test set RMSE of rf: {:.2f}'.format(rmse_test))
```

<p class="">Great work! You can try training a single CART on the same dataset. The test set RMSE achieved by <code>rf</code> is significantly smaller than that achieved by a single CART!</p>

##### Visualizing features importances {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll determine which features were the most predictive according to the random forests regressor <code>rf</code> that you trained in a previous exercise. </p>
<p>For this purpose, you'll draw a horizontal barplot of the feature importance as assessed by <code>rf</code>. Fortunately, this can be done easily thanks to plotting capabilities of <code>pandas</code>.</p>
<p>We have created a <code>pandas.Series</code> object called <code>importances</code> containing the feature names as <code>index</code> and their importances as values. In addition, <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> is available as <code>plt</code> and <code>pandas</code> as <code>pd</code>.</p>
</div>

<li>Call the <code>.sort_values()</code> method on <code>importances</code> and assign the result to <code>importances_sorted</code>.</li>

<li>

Call the <code>.plot()</code> method on <code>importances_sorted</code> and set the arguments:

```{python}
# Create a pd.Series of features importances

### Boosting {.unnumbered}

<p class="chapter__description">
    Boosting refers to an ensemble method in which several models are trained sequentially with each model learning from the errors of its predecessors. In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the two boosting methods of AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.
  </p>

#### Adaboost {.unnumbered}



##### Define the AdaBoost classifier {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In the following exercises you'll revisit the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records">Indian Liver Patient</a> dataset which was introduced in a previous chapter. Your task is to predict whether a patient suffers from a liver disease using 10 features including Albumin, age and gender. However, this time, you'll be training an AdaBoost ensemble to perform the classification task. In addition, given that this dataset is imbalanced, you'll be using the ROC AUC score as a metric instead of accuracy.</p>
<p>As a first step, you'll start by instantiating an AdaBoost classifier.</p>
</div>


<li>Import <code>AdaBoostClassifier</code> from <code>sklearn.ensemble</code>.</li>

<li>Instantiate a <code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code> with <code>max_depth</code> set to 2.</li>

<li>Instantiate an <code>AdaBoostClassifier</code> consisting of 180 trees and setting the <code>base_estimator</code> to <code>dt</code>.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
indian_liver_patient = pd.read_csv("archive/Machine-Learning-with-Tree-Based-Models-in-Python/datasets/indian_liver_patient.csv")
df = indian_liver_patient.rename(columns={'Dataset':'Liver_disease'})
df = df.dropna()
X = df[['Age', 'Total_Bilirubin', 
        'Direct_Bilirubin',
        'Alkaline_Phosphotase',
        'Alamine_Aminotransferase', 'Aspartate_Aminotransferase',
       'Total_Protiens', 'Albumin', 'Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio', 'Gender']]
LabelEncoder = sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
X['Is_male'] = LabelEncoder.fit_transform(X['Gender'])
X = X.drop(columns='Gender')
y = df['Liver_disease']-1
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(X,y)

# Import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=1)

# Instantiate ada
ada = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=dt, 
n_estimators=180, random_state=1)
```

<p class="">Well done! Next comes training <code>ada</code> and evaluating the probability of obtaining the positive class in the test set.</p>

##### Train the AdaBoost classifier {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now that you've instantiated the AdaBoost classifier <code>ada</code>, it's time train it. You will also predict the probabilities of obtaining the positive class in the test set. This can be done as follows: </p>
<p>Once the classifier <code>ada</code> is trained, call the <code>.predict_proba()</code> method by passing <code>X_test</code> as a parameter and extract these probabilities by slicing all the values in the second column as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ada.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
</code></pre>
<p>The Indian Liver dataset is processed for you and split into 80% train and 20% test. Feature matrices <code>X_train</code> and <code>X_test</code>, as well as the arrays of labels <code>y_train</code> and <code>y_test</code> are available in your workspace. In addition, we have also loaded the 
instantiated model <code>ada</code> from the previous exercise.</p>
</div>

<li>Fit <code>ada</code> to the training set.</li>

<li>Evaluate the probabilities of obtaining the positive class in the test set.</li>
```{python}
# Fit ada to the training set
ada.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Compute the probabilities of obtaining the positive class
y_pred_proba = ada.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
```

<p class="">Great work! Next, you'll evaluate <code>ada</code>'s ROC AUC score.</p>

##### Evaluate the AdaBoost classifier {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now that you're done training <code>ada</code> and predicting the probabilities of obtaining the positive class in the test set, it's time to evaluate <code>ada</code>'s ROC AUC score. Recall that the ROC AUC score of a binary classifier can be determined using the <code>roc_auc_score()</code> function from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</p>
<p>The arrays <code>y_test</code> and <code>y_pred_proba</code> that you computed in the previous exercise are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>roc_auc_score</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code>.</li>

<li>Compute <code>ada</code>'s test set ROC AUC score, assign it to <code>ada_roc_auc</code>, and print it out.</li>
```{python}
# Import roc_auc_score
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# Evaluate test-set roc_auc_score
ada_roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)

# Print roc_auc_score
print('ROC AUC score: {:.2f}'.format(ada_roc_auc))
```

<p class="">Not bad! This untuned AdaBoost classifier achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.70!</p>

#### Gradient Boosting (GB) {.unnumbered}



##### Define the GB regressor {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>You'll now revisit the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand">Bike Sharing Demand</a> dataset that was introduced in the previous chapter. Recall that your task is to predict the bike rental demand using historical weather data from the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.. For this purpose, you'll be using a gradient boosting regressor.</p>
<p>As a first step, you'll start by instantiating a gradient boosting regressor which you will train in the next exercise.</p>

from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

# Instantiate gb
gb = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=4, 
            n_estimators=200,
            random_state=2)
```

<p class="">Awesome! Time to train the regressor and predict test set labels.</p>

##### Train the GB regressor {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>You'll now train the gradient boosting regressor <code>gb</code> that you instantiated in the previous exercise and predict test set labels.</p>

In addition, we have also loaded the model instance <code>gb</code> that you defined in the previous exercise.</p>
</div>

<li>Fit <code>gb</code> to the training set. </li>

```{python}
# Fit gb to the training set
gb.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = gb.predict(X_test)
```

<p class="">Great work! Time to evaluate the test set RMSE!</p>

##### Evaluate the GB regressor {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now that the test set predictions are available, you can use them to evaluate the test set Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of <code>gb</code>. </p>
<p><code>y_test</code> and predictions <code>y_pred</code> are available in your workspace.</p>
</div>

<li>Import <code>mean_squared_error</code> from <code>sklearn.metrics</code> as <code>MSE</code>.</li>

<li>Compute the test set MSE and assign it to <code>mse_test</code>. </li>

<li>Compute the test set RMSE and assign it to <code>rmse_test</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import mean_squared_error as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Compute MSE
mse_test = MSE(y_test, y_pred)

# Compute RMSE
rmse_test = mse_test**0.5

# Print RMSE
print('Test set RMSE of gb: {:.3f}'.format(rmse_test))
```

### Model Tuning {.unnumbered}

<p class="chapter__description">
    The hyperparameters of a machine learning model are parameters that are not learned from data. They should be set prior to fitting the model to the training set. In this chapter, you'll learn how to tune the hyperparameters of a tree-based model using grid search cross validation.
  </p>

<p class="">Well done! There is no hyperparameter named <code>min_features</code>.</p>

##### Set the tree's hyperparameter grid {.unnumbered}


<div class><p>In this exercise, you'll manually set the grid of hyperparameters that will be used to tune the classification tree <code>dt</code> and find the optimal classifier in the next exercise.</p></div>

<li>

Define a grid of hyperparameters corresponding to a Python dictionary called <code>params_dt</code> with:

<li>the key <code>'max_depth'</code> set to a list of values 2, 3, and 4</li>

<li>the key <code>'min_samples_leaf'</code> set to a list of values 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, 0.18</li>


</li>

```

<p class="">Great! Next comes performing the grid search.</p>

##### Search for the optimal tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll perform grid search using 5-fold cross validation to find <code>dt</code>'s optimal hyperparameters. Note that because grid search is an exhaustive process, it may take a lot time to train the model. Here you'll only be instantiating the <code>GridSearchCV</code> object without fitting it to the training set. As discussed in the video, you can train such an object similar to any scikit-learn estimator by using the <code>.fit()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>grid_object.fit(X_train, y_train)
</code></pre>
<p>An untuned classification tree <code>dt</code> as well as the dictionary <code>params_dt</code> that you defined in the previous exercise are available in your workspace.</p>

##### Evaluate the optimal tree {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll evaluate the test set ROC AUC score of <code>grid_dt</code>'s optimal model. </p>
<p>In order to do so, you will first determine the probability of obtaining the positive label for each test set observation. You can use the method<code>predict_proba()</code> of an sklearn classifier to compute a 2D array containing the probabilities of the negative and positive class-labels respectively along columns.</p>
<p>The dataset is already loaded and processed for you (numerical features are standardized); it is split into 80% train and 20% test. <code>X_test</code>, <code>y_test</code> are available in your workspace.

```{python}
# edited/added
grid_dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Import roc_auc_score from sklearn.metrics
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# Extract the best estimator
best_model = grid_dt.best_estimator_

# Predict the test set probabilities of the positive class
y_pred_proba = best_model.predict_proba(X_test )[:,1]

# Compute test_roc_auc
test_roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred_proba)

# Print test_roc_auc
print('Test set ROC AUC score: {:.3f}'.format(test_roc_auc))

#### Congratulations! {.unnumbered}


##### Congratulations! {.unnumbered}

Congratulations on completing this course!

##### How far you have come {.unnumbered}

Take a moment to take a look at how far you have come! In chapter 1, you started off by understanding and applying the CART algorithm to train decision trees or CARTs for problems involving classification and regression. In chapter 2, you understood what the generalization error of a supervised learning model is. In addition, you also learned how underfitting and overfitting can be diagnosed with cross-validation. Furthermore, you learned how model ensembling can produce results that are more robust than individual decision trees. In chapter 3, you applied randomization through bootstrapping and constructed a diverse set of trees in an ensemble through bagging. You also explored how random forests introduces further randomization by sampling features at the level of each node in each tree forming the ensemble. Chapter 4 introduced you to boosting, an ensemble method in which predictors are trained sequentially and where each predictor tries to correct the errors made by its predecessor. Specifically, you saw how AdaBoost involved tweaking the weights of the training samples while gradient boosting involved fitting each tree using the residuals of its predecessor as labels. You also learned how subsampling instances and features can lead to a better performance through Stochastic Gradient Boosting. Finally, in chapter 5, you explored hyperparameter tuning through Grid Search cross-validation and you learned how important it is to get the most out of your models.

##### Thank you! {.unnumbered}

I hope you enjoyed taking this course as much as I enjoyed developing it. Finally, I encourage you to apply the skills you learned by practicing on real-world datasets.
