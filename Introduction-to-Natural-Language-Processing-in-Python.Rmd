**Course Description**

<p class="course__description">In this course, you'll learn natural language processing (NLP) basics, such as how to identify and separate words, how to extract topics in a text, and how to build your own fake news classifier. You'll also learn how to use basic libraries such as NLTK, alongside libraries which utilize deep learning to solve common NLP problems. This course will give you the foundation to process and parse text as you move forward in your Python learning.</p>

### Regular expressions & word tokenization {.unnumbered}

<p class="chapter__description">
    This chapter will introduce some basic NLP concepts, such as word tokenization and regular expressions to help parse text. You'll also learn how to handle non-English text and more difficult tokenization you might find.
  </p>

#### Regular expressions {.unnumbered}



##### Which pattern? {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Which of the following Regex patterns results in the following text? </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_string = "Let's write RegEx!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(PATTERN, my_string)
['Let', 's', 'write', 'RegEx']
</code></pre>
<p>In the IPython Shell, try replacing <code>PATTERN</code> with one of the below options and observe the resulting output. The <code>re</code> module has been pre-imported for you and <code>my_string</code> is available in your namespace.</p>
</div>

```{python}
# edited/added
import re
from pprint import pprint
my_string = "Let's write RegEx!"
PATTERN = r"\w+"
re.findall(PATTERN, my_string)
```

- [ ] PATTERN = r"\s+"
- [x] PATTERN = r"\w+"
- [ ] PATTERN = r"[a-z]"
- [ ] PATTERN = r"\w"

<p class="">Well done!</p>

##### Practicing regular expressions: re.split() and re.findall() {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now you'll get a chance to write some regular expressions to match digits, strings and non-alphanumeric characters. Take a look at <code>my_string</code> first by printing it in the IPython Shell, to determine how you might best match the different steps.</p>
<p>Note: It's important to prefix your regex patterns with <code>r</code> to ensure that your patterns are interpreted in the way you want them to. Else, you may encounter problems to do with escape sequences in strings. For example, <code>"\n"</code> in Python is used to indicate a new line, but if you use the <code>r</code> prefix, it will be interpreted as the raw string <code>"\n"</code> - that is, the character <code>"\"</code> followed by the character <code>"n"</code> - and not as a new line.</p>
<p>The regular expression module <code>re</code> has already been imported for you.</p>
<p><em>Remember from the video that the syntax for the regex library is to always to pass the <strong>pattern first</strong>, and then the <strong>string second</strong>.</em></p>
</div>


<li>Split <code>my_string</code> on each sentence ending. To do this:
<li>Write a pattern called <code>sentence_endings</code> to match sentence endings (<code>.?!</code>).</li>
<li>Use <code>re.split()</code> to split <code>my_string</code> on the pattern and print the result.</li>

</li>
<li>Find and print all capitalized words in <code>my_string</code> by writing a pattern called <code>capitalized_words</code> and using <code>re.findall()</code>. <li>Remember the <code>[a-z]</code> pattern shown in the video to match lowercase groups? Modify that pattern appropriately in order to match uppercase groups.</li>
</li>
<li>Write a pattern called <code>spaces</code> to match one or more spaces (<code>"\s+"</code>) and then use <code>re.split()</code> to split <code>my_string</code> on this pattern, keeping all punctuation intact. Print the result.</li>
<li>Find all digits in <code>my_string</code> by writing a pattern called <code>digits</code> (<code>"\d+"</code>) and using <code>re.findall()</code>. Print the result.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
import re
my_string = "Let's write RegEx!  Won't that be fun?  I sure think so.  Can you find 4 sentences?  Or perhaps, all 19 words?"

# Write a pattern to match sentence endings: sentence_endings
sentence_endings = r"[.?!]"

# Split my_string on sentence endings and print the result
print(re.split(sentence_endings, my_string))

# Find all capitalized words in my_string and print the result
capitalized_words = r"[A-Z]\w+"
print(re.findall(capitalized_words, my_string))

# Split my_string on spaces and print the result
spaces = r"\s+"
print(re.split(spaces, my_string))

# Find all digits in my_string and print the result
digits = r"\d+"
print(re.findall(digits, my_string))
```

<p class="">Nicely done! Practice is the key to mastering RegEx.</p>

#### Tokenization {.unnumbered}



##### Word tokenization with NLTK {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Here, you'll be using the first scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail, which has been pre-loaded as <code>scene_one</code>. Feel free to check it out in the IPython Shell!</p>
<p>Your job in this exercise is to utilize <code>word_tokenize</code> and <code>sent_tokenize</code> from <code>nltk.tokenize</code> to tokenize both words and sentences from Python strings - in this case, the first scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail.</p>
</div>


<li>Import the <code>sent_tokenize</code> and <code>word_tokenize</code> functions from <code>nltk.tokenize</code>.</li>
<li>Tokenize all the sentences in <code>scene_one</code> using the <code>sent_tokenize()</code> function.</li>
<li>Tokenize the fourth sentence in <code>sentences</code>, which you can access as <code>sentences[3]</code>, using the <code>word_tokenize()</code> function. </li>
<li>Find the unique tokens in the entire scene by using <code>word_tokenize()</code> on <code>scene_one</code> and then converting it into a set using <code>set()</code>.</li>
<li>Print the unique tokens found. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results!</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
with open('archive/Introduction-to-Natural-Language-Processing-in-Python/datasets/grail.txt', 'r') as file:
    holy_grail = file.read()
    scene_one = re.split('SCENE 2:', holy_grail)[0]
    
# Import necessary modules
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')

# Split scene_one into sentences: sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(scene_one)

# Use word_tokenize to tokenize the fourth sentence: tokenized_sent
tokenized_sent = word_tokenize(sentences[3])

# Make a set of unique tokens in the entire scene: unique_tokens
unique_tokens = set(word_tokenize(scene_one))

# Print the unique tokens result
print(unique_tokens)
```

<p class="">Excellent! Tokenization is fundamental to NLP, and you'll end up using it a lot in text mining and information retrieval projects.</p>

##### More regex with re.search() {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll utilize <code>re.search()</code> and <code>re.match()</code> to find specific tokens. Both <code>search</code> and <code>match</code> expect regex patterns, similar to those you defined in an earlier exercise. You'll apply these regex library methods to the same Monty Python text from the <code>nltk</code> corpora.</p>
<p>You have both <code>scene_one</code> and <code>sentences</code> available from the last exercise; now you can use them with <code>re.search()</code> and <code>re.match()</code> to extract and match more text.</p>
</div>


<li>Use <code>re.search()</code> to search for the first occurrence of the word <code>"coconuts"</code> in <code>scene_one</code>. Store the result in <code>match</code>.</li>
<li>Print the start and end indexes of <code>match</code> using its <code>.start()</code> and <code>.end()</code> methods, respectively.</li>



<li>Write a regular expression called <code>pattern1</code> to find anything in square brackets.</li>
<li>Use <code>re.search()</code> with the pattern to find the first text in <code>scene_one</code> in square brackets in the scene. Print the result.</li>



<li>Create a pattern to match the script notation (e.g. <code>Character:</code>), assigning the result to <code>pattern2</code>. <em>Remember that you will want to match any words or spaces that precede the <code>:</code> (such as the space within <code>SOLDIER #1:</code>).</em></li>
<li>Use <code>re.match()</code> with your new pattern to find and print the script notation in the <strong>fourth</strong> line. The tokenized sentences are available in your namespace as <code>sentences</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Search for the first occurrence of "coconuts" in scene_one: match
match = re.search("coconuts", scene_one)

# Print the start and end indexes of match
print(match.start(), match.end())

# Write a regular expression to search for anything in square brackets: pattern1
pattern1 = r"\[.*\]"

# Use re.search to find the first text in square brackets
print(re.search(pattern1, scene_one))

# Find the script notation at the beginning of the fourth sentence and print it
pattern2 = r"[\w\s]+:"
print(re.match(pattern2, sentences[3]))
```

<p class="">Fantastic work! Now that you're familiar with the basics of tokenization and regular expressions, it's time to learn about more advanced tokenization.</p>

#### Advanced tokenization {.unnumbered}



##### Choosing a tokenizer {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Given the following string, which of the below patterns is the best tokenizer? If possible, you want to retain sentence punctuation as separate tokens, but have <code>'#1'</code> remain a single token.</p>
<pre><code>my_string = "SOLDIER #1: Found them? In Mercea? The coconut's tropical!"
</code></pre>
<p>The string is available in your workspace as <code>my_string</code>, and the patterns have been pre-loaded as <code>pattern1</code>, <code>pattern2</code>, <code>pattern3</code>, and <code>pattern4</code>, respectively. </p>
<p>Additionally, <code>regexp_tokenize</code> has been imported from <code>nltk.tokenize</code>. You can use <code>regexp_tokenize(string, pattern)</code> with <code>my_string</code> and one of the patterns as arguments to experiment for yourself and see which is the best tokenizer.</p>
</div>

```{python}
# edited/added
from pprint import pprint
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
my_string = "SOLDIER #1: Found them? In Mercea? The coconut's tropical!"
pattern1 = r'(\\w+|\\?|!)'
pattern2 = r"(\w+|#\d|\?|!)"
pattern3 = r'(#\\d\\w+\\?!)'
pattern4 = r'\\s+'
pprint(regexp_tokenize(my_string, pattern2))
```

- [ ] r"(\w+|\?|!)"
- [x] r"(\w+|#\d|\?|!)"
- [ ] r"(#\d\w+\?!)"
- [ ] r"\s+"

<p class="">Well done!</p>

##### Regex with NLTK tokenization {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Twitter is a frequently used source for NLP text and tasks. In this exercise, you'll build a more complex tokenizer for tweets with hashtags and mentions using <code>nltk</code> and regex. The <code>nltk.tokenize.TweetTokenizer</code> class gives you some extra methods and attributes for parsing tweets. </p>
<p>Here, you're given some example tweets to parse using both <code>TweetTokenizer</code> and <code>regexp_tokenize</code> from the <code>nltk.tokenize</code> module. These example tweets have been pre-loaded into the variable <code>tweets</code>. Feel free to explore it in the IPython Shell!</p>
<p><em>Unlike the syntax for the regex library, with <code>nltk_tokenize()</code> you pass the pattern as the <strong>second</strong> argument.</em></p>
</div>


<li>From <code>nltk.tokenize</code>, import <code>regexp_tokenize</code> and <code>TweetTokenizer</code>.</li>



<li>A regex pattern to define hashtags called <code>pattern1</code> has been defined for you. Call <code>regexp_tokenize()</code> with this hashtag pattern on the <strong>first</strong> tweet in <code>tweets</code> and assign the result to <code>hashtags</code>.</li>
<li>Print <code>hashtags</code> (this has already been done for you).</li>


<div class="exercise--instructions__content"><ul>
<li><p>Write a new pattern called <code>pattern2</code> to match mentions and hashtags. A mention is something like <code>@DataCamp</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Then, call <code>regexp_tokenize()</code> with your new hashtag pattern on the <strong>last</strong> tweet in <code>tweets</code> and assign the result to <code>mentions_hashtags</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can access the last element of a list using <code>-1</code> as the index, for example, <code>tweets[-1]</code>.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Print <code>mentions_hashtags</code> (this has been done for you).</p></li>
</ul></div>


<div class="exercise--instructions__content"><ul>
<li>Create an instance of <code>TweetTokenizer</code> called <code>tknzr</code> and use it inside a list comprehension to tokenize each tweet into a new list called <code>all_tokens</code>. <ul>
<li>To do this, use the <code>.tokenize()</code> method of <code>tknzr</code>, with <code>t</code> as your iterator variable.</li></ul></li>
<li>Print <code>all_tokens</code>.</li>
</ul></div>
```{python}
# edited/added
tweets = ['This is the best #nlp exercise ive found online! #python',
 '#NLP is super fun! <3 #learning',
 'Thanks @datacamp :) #nlp #python']
 
# Import the necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer

# Import the necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer
# Define a regex pattern to find hashtags: pattern1
pattern1 = r"#\w+"
# Use the pattern on the first tweet in the tweets list
hashtags = regexp_tokenize(tweets[0], pattern1)
print(hashtags)

# Import the necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer
# Write a pattern that matches both mentions (@) and hashtags
pattern2 = r"([@#]\w+)"
# Use the pattern on the last tweet in the tweets list
mentions_hashtags = regexp_tokenize(tweets[-1], pattern2)
print(mentions_hashtags)

# Import the necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer
# Use the TweetTokenizer to tokenize all tweets into one list
tknzr = TweetTokenizer()
all_tokens = [tknzr.tokenize(t) for t in tweets]
print(all_tokens)
```

<p class="">Well done! Isn't NLP fun?</p>

##### Non-ascii tokenization {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll practice advanced tokenization by tokenizing some non-ascii based text. You'll be using German with emoji!</p>
<p>Here, you have access to a string called <code>german_text</code>, which has been printed for you in the Shell. Notice the emoji and the German characters!</p>
<p>The following modules have been pre-imported from <code>nltk.tokenize</code>: <code>regexp_tokenize</code> and <code>word_tokenize</code>. </p>
<p>Unicode ranges for emoji are:</p>
<p><code>('\U0001F300'-'\U0001F5FF')</code>, <code>('\U0001F600-\U0001F64F')</code>, <code>('\U0001F680-\U0001F6FF')</code>, and <code>('\u2600'-\u26FF-\u2700-\u27BF')</code>.</p>
</div>


<li>Tokenize all the words in <code>german_text</code> using <code>word_tokenize()</code>, and print the result.</li>
<li>Tokenize only the capital words in <code>german_text</code>. 
<li>First, write a pattern called <code>capital_words</code> to match only capital words. Make sure to check for the German <code>Ü</code>! To use this character in the exercise, copy and paste it from these instructions.</li>
<li>Then, tokenize it using <code>regexp_tokenize()</code>. </li>

</li>
<li>Tokenize only the emoji in <code>german_text</code>. The pattern using the unicode ranges for emoji given in the assignment text has been written for you. Your job is to use <code>regexp_tokenize()</code> to tokenize the emoji.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
german_text = 'Wann gehen wir Pizza essen? 🍕 Und fährst du mit Über? 🚕'

# Tokenize and print all words in german_text
all_words = word_tokenize(german_text)
print(all_words)

# Tokenize and print only capital words
capital_words = r"[A-ZÜ]\w+"
print(regexp_tokenize(german_text, capital_words))

# Tokenize and print only emoji
emoji = "['\U0001F300-\U0001F5FF'|'\U0001F600-\U0001F64F'|'\U0001F680-\U0001F6FF'|'\u2600-\u26FF\u2700-\u27BF']"
print(regexp_tokenize(german_text, emoji))
```

<p class="">Wonderful!</p>

#### Charting word length {.unnumbered}



##### Charting practice {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Try using your new skills to find and chart the number of words per line in the script using <code>matplotlib</code>. The Holy Grail script is loaded for you, and you need to use regex to find the words per line. </p>
<p>Using list comprehensions here will speed up your computations. For example: <code>my_lines = [tokenize(l) for l in lines]</code> will call a function <code>tokenize</code> on each line in the list <code>lines</code>. The new transformed list will be saved in the <code>my_lines</code> variable.</p>
<p>You have access to the entire script in the variable <code>holy_grail</code>. Go for it!</p>
</div>


<li>Split the script <code>holy_grail</code> into lines using the newline (<code>'\n'</code>) character.</li>
<li>Use <code>re.sub()</code> inside a list comprehension to replace the prompts such as <code>ARTHUR:</code> and <code>SOLDIER #1</code>. The pattern has been written for you. </li>
<li>Use a list comprehension to tokenize <code>lines</code> with <code>regexp_tokenize()</code>, keeping <strong>only words</strong>. Recall that the pattern for words is <code>"\w+"</code>.</li>
<li>Use a list comprehension to create a list of line lengths called <code>line_num_words</code>.<li>Use <code>t_line</code> as your iterator variable to iterate over <code>tokenized_lines</code>, and then <code>len()</code> function to compute line lengths.</li>
</li>
<li>Plot a histogram of <code>line_num_words</code> using <code>plt.hist()</code>. Don't forgot to use <code>plt.show()</code> as well to display the plot.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Split the script into lines: lines
lines = holy_grail.split('\n')

# Replace all script lines for speaker
pattern = "[A-Z]{2,}(\s)?(#\d)?([A-Z]{2,})?:"
lines = [re.sub(pattern, '', l) for l in lines]

# Tokenize each line: tokenized_lines
tokenized_lines = [regexp_tokenize(s, "\w+") for s in lines]

# Make a frequency list of lengths: line_num_words
line_num_words = [len(t_line) for t_line in tokenized_lines]

# Plot a histogram of the line lengths
plt.hist(line_num_words)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

<p class="">Well done, and congratulations on finishing Chapter 1! See you in Chapter 2, where you'll begin learning about topic identification!</p>

### Topic identification {.unnumbered}

<p class="chapter__description">
    This chapter will introduce you to topic identification, which you can apply to any text you encounter in the wild. Using basic NLP models, you will identify topics from texts based on term frequencies. You'll experiment and compare two simple methods: bag-of-words and Tf-idf using NLTK, and a new library Gensim.
  </p>

#### Bag-of-words {.unnumbered}



##### Bag-of-words picker {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>It's time for a quick check on your understanding of bag-of-words. Which of the below options, with basic <code>nltk</code> tokenization, map the bag-of-words for the following text?</p>
<p>"The cat is in the box. The cat box."</p>
</div>

```{python}
# edited/added
my_string = "The cat is in the box. The cat box."

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from collections import Counter

Counter(word_tokenize(my_string)).most_common(len(word_tokenize(my_string)))
```

- [ ] ('the', 3), ('box.', 2), ('cat', 2), ('is', 1)
- [ ] ('The', 3), ('box', 2), ('cat', 2), ('is', 1), ('in', 1), ('.', 1)
- [ ] ('the', 3), ('cat box', 1), ('cat', 1), ('box', 1), ('is', 1), ('in', 1)
- [x] ('The', 2), ('box', 2), ('.', 2), ('cat', 2), ('is', 1), ('in', 1), ('the', 1)

<p class="">Well done!</p>

##### Building a Counter with bag-of-words {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll build your first (in this course) bag-of-words counter using a Wikipedia article, which has been pre-loaded as <code>article</code>. Try doing the bag-of-words without looking at the full article text, and guessing what the topic is! If you'd like to peek at the title at the end, we've included it as <code>article_title</code>. Note that this article text has had very little preprocessing from the raw Wikipedia database entry.</p>
<p><code>word_tokenize</code> has been imported for you.</p>
</div>


<li>Import <code>Counter</code> from <code>collections</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>word_tokenize()</code> to split the article into tokens.</li>
<li>Use a list comprehension with <code>t</code> as the iterator variable to convert all the tokens into lowercase. The <code>.lower()</code> method converts text into lowercase.</li>
<li>Create a bag-of-words counter called <code>bow_simple</code> by using <code>Counter()</code> with <code>lower_tokens</code> as the argument.</li>
<li>Use the <code>.most_common()</code> method of <code>bow_simple</code> to print the 10 most common tokens.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
import re
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

with open('archive/Introduction-to-Natural-Language-Processing-in-Python/datasets/wikipedia_articles/wiki_text_debugging.txt', 'r') as file:
    article = file.read()
    article_title = word_tokenize(article)[2]
    
# Import Counter
from collections import Counter

# Tokenize the article: tokens
tokens = word_tokenize(article)

# Convert the tokens into lowercase: lower_tokens
lower_tokens = [t.lower() for t in tokens]

# Create a Counter with the lowercase tokens: bow_simple
bow_simple = Counter(lower_tokens)

# Print the 10 most common tokens
print(bow_simple.most_common(10))
```

<p class="">Great work!</p>

#### Text preprocessing {.unnumbered}

<div class=""><p>Which of the following are useful text preprocessing steps?</p></div>

- [ ] Stems, spelling corrections, lowercase.
- [x] Lemmatization, lowercasing, removing unwanted tokens.
- [ ] Removing stop words, leaving in capital words.
- [ ] Strip stop words, word endings and digits.

<p class="dc-completion-pane__message dc-u-maxw-100pc">Well done!</p>

##### Text preprocessing steps {.unnumbered}



##### Text preprocessing practice {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now, it's your turn to apply the techniques you've learned to help clean up text for better NLP results. You'll need to remove stop words and non-alphabetic characters, lemmatize, and perform a new bag-of-words on your cleaned text.</p>
<p>You start with the same tokens you created in the last exercise: <code>lower_tokens</code>. You also have the <code>Counter</code> class imported.</p>
</div>


<li>Import the <code>WordNetLemmatizer</code> class from <code>nltk.stem</code>. </li>
<li>Create a list <code>alpha_only</code> that contains <strong>only</strong> alphabetical characters. You can use the <code>.isalpha()</code> method to check for this.</li>
<li>Create another list called <code>no_stops</code> consisting of words from <code>alpha_only</code> that <strong>are not</strong> contained in <code>english_stops</code>.</li>
<li>Initialize a <code>WordNetLemmatizer</code> object called <code>wordnet_lemmatizer</code> and use its <code>.lemmatize()</code> method on the tokens in <code>no_stops</code> to create a new list called <code>lemmatized</code>.</li>
<li>Create a new <code>Counter</code> called <code>bow</code> with the lemmatized words.</li>
<li>Lastly, print the 10 most common tokens.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')

with open('archive/Introduction-to-Natural-Language-Processing-in-Python/datasets/english_stopwords.txt', 'r') as file:
    english_stops = file.read()
    
# Import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
nltk.download('omw-1.4')

# Retain alphabetic words: alpha_only
alpha_only = [t for t in lower_tokens if t.isalpha()]

# Remove all stop words: no_stops
no_stops = [t for t in alpha_only if t not in english_stops]

# Instantiate the WordNetLemmatizer
wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

# Lemmatize all tokens into a new list: lemmatized
lemmatized = [wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in no_stops]

# Create the bag-of-words: bow
bow = Counter(lemmatized)

# Print the 10 most common tokens
print(bow.most_common(10))
```

<p class="">Great work!</p>

#### Gensim {.unnumbered}



##### What are word vectors? {.unnumbered}

<div class=""><p>What are word vectors and how do they help with NLP?</p></div>

- [ ] They are similar to bags of words, just with numbers. You use them to count how many tokens there are.
- [ ] Word vectors are sparse arrays representing bigrams in the corpora. You can use them to compare two sets of words to one another.
- [x] Word vectors are multi-dimensional mathematical representations of words created using deep learning methods. They give us insight into relationships between words in a corpus.
- [ ] Word vectors don't actually help NLP and are just hype.

<p class="dc-completion-pane__message dc-u-maxw-100pc">Well done! Keep working to use some word vectors yourself!</p>

##### Creating and querying a corpus with gensim {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>It's time to apply the methods you learned in the previous video to create your first <code>gensim</code> dictionary and corpus! </p>
<p>You'll use these data structures to investigate word trends and potential interesting topics in your document set. To get started, we have imported a few additional messy articles from Wikipedia, which were preprocessed by lowercasing all words, tokenizing them, and removing stop words and punctuation. These were then stored in a list of document tokens called <code>articles</code>. You'll need to do some light preprocessing and then generate the <code>gensim</code> dictionary and corpus.</p>
</div>


<li>Import <code>Dictionary</code> from <code>gensim.corpora.dictionary</code>.</li>
<li>Initialize a <code>gensim</code> <code>Dictionary</code> with the tokens in <code>articles</code>.</li>
<li>Obtain the id for <code>"computer"</code> from <code>dictionary</code>. To do this, use its <code>.token2id</code> method which returns ids from text, and then chain <code>.get()</code> which returns tokens from ids. Pass in <code>"computer"</code> as an argument to <code>.get()</code>.</li>
<li>Use a list comprehension in which you iterate over <code>articles</code> to create a <code>gensim</code> <code>MmCorpus</code> from <code>dictionary</code>.<li>In the output expression, use the <code>.doc2bow()</code> method on <code>dictionary</code> with <code>article</code> as the argument.</li>
</li>
<li>Print the first 10 word ids with their frequency counts from the fifth document. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results!</li>

##### Gensim bag-of-words {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now, you'll use your new <code>gensim</code> corpus and dictionary to see the most common terms per document and across all documents. You can use your dictionary to look up the terms. Take a guess at what the topics are and feel free to explore more documents in the IPython Shell! </p>
<p>You have access to the <code>dictionary</code> and <code>corpus</code> objects you created in the previous exercise, as well as the Python <code>defaultdict</code> and <code>itertools</code> to help with the creation of intermediate data structures for analysis. </p>

<li><p><code>defaultdict</code> allows us to initialize a dictionary that will assign a default value to non-existent keys. By supplying the argument <code>int</code>, we are able to ensure that any non-existent keys are automatically assigned a default value of <code>0</code>. This makes it ideal for storing the counts of words in this exercise.</p></li>
<li><p><code>itertools.chain.from_iterable()</code> allows us to iterate through a set of sequences as if they were one continuous sequence. Using this function, we can easily iterate through our <code>corpus</code> object (which is a list of lists).</p></li>

<p>The fifth document from <code>corpus</code> is stored in the variable <code>doc</code>, which has been sorted in descending order.</p>
</div>


<li>
<p>Using the first <code>for</code> loop, print the top five words of <code>bow_doc</code> using each <code>word_id</code> with the <code>dictionary</code> alongside <code>word_count</code>. </p>
<li>The <code>word_id</code> can be accessed using the <code>.get()</code> method of <code>dictionary</code>.</li>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>defaultdict</code> called <code>total_word_count</code> in which the keys are all the token ids (<code>word_id</code>) and the values are the sum of their occurrence across all documents (<code>word_count</code>). </p>
<li>Remember to specify <code>int</code> when creating the <code>defaultdict</code>, and inside the second <code>for</code> loop, increment each <code>word_id</code> of <code>total_word_count</code> by <code>word_count</code>.</li>
</li>



<li>Create a sorted list from the <code>defaultdict</code>, using words across the entire corpus. To achieve this, use the <code>.items()</code> method on <code>total_word_count</code> inside <code>sorted()</code>.</li>
<li>Similar to how you printed the top five words of <code>bow_doc</code> earlier, print the top five words of <code>sorted_word_count</code> as well as the number of occurrences of each word across all the documents.</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
from collections import defaultdict
import itertools

# Save the fifth document: doc
doc = corpus[4]

# Sort the doc for frequency: bow_doc
bow_doc = sorted(doc, key=lambda w: w[1], reverse=True)

# Print the top 5 words of the document alongside the count
for word_id, word_count in bow_doc[:5]:
    print(dictionary.get(word_id), word_count)
    
# Create the defaultdict: total_word_count
total_word_count = defaultdict(int)
for word_id, word_count in itertools.chain.from_iterable(corpus):
    total_word_count[word_id] += word_count
    
# Save the fifth document: doc
doc = corpus[4]

# Sort the doc for frequency: bow_doc
bow_doc = sorted(doc, key=lambda w: w[1], reverse=True)

# Print the top 5 words of the document alongside the count
for word_id, word_count in bow_doc[:5]:
    print(dictionary.get(word_id), word_count)
    
# Create the defaultdict: total_word_count
total_word_count = defaultdict(int)
for word_id, word_count in itertools.chain.from_iterable(corpus):
    total_word_count[word_id] += word_count

# Create a sorted list from the defaultdict: sorted_word_count 
sorted_word_count = sorted(total_word_count.items(), key=lambda w: w[1], reverse=True) 

# Print the top 5 words across all documents alongside the count
for word_id, word_count in sorted_word_count[:5]:
    print(dictionary.get(word_id), word_count)
```

<p class="">Good work!</p>

#### Tf-idf {.unnumbered}



##### What is tf-idf? {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>You want to calculate the tf-idf weight for the word <code>"computer"</code>, which appears five times in a document containing 100 words. Given a corpus containing 200 documents, with 20 documents mentioning the word <code>"computer"</code>, tf-idf can be calculated by multiplying term frequency with inverse document frequency.</p>
<p>Term frequency = percentage share of the word compared to all tokens in the document
Inverse document frequency = logarithm of the total number of documents in a corpora divided by the number of documents containing the term</p>
<p>Which of the below options is correct?</p>
</div>

- [x] (5 / 100) * log(200 / 20)
- [ ] (5 * 100) / log(200 * 20)
- [ ] (20 / 5) * log(200 / 20)
- [ ] (200 * 5) * log(400 / 5)

Will tf-idf make for more interesting results on the document level?</p>
<p><code>TfidfModel</code> has been imported for you from <code>gensim.models.tfidfmodel</code>.</p>
</div>


<li>Initialize a new <code>TfidfModel</code> called <code>tfidf</code> using <code>corpus</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>doc</code> to calculate the weights. You can do this by passing <code>[doc]</code> to <code>tfidf</code>.</li>
<li>Print the first five term ids with weights.</li>



<li>Sort the term ids and weights in a new list from highest to lowest weight. <em>This has been done for you.</em> </li>
<li>Using your pre-existing <code>dictionary</code>, print the top five weighted words (<code>term_id</code>) from <code>sorted_tfidf_weights</code>, along with their weighted score (<code>weight</code>).</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
from gensim.models.tfidfmodel import TfidfModel

# Create a new TfidfModel using the corpus: tfidf
tfidf = TfidfModel(corpus)

# Calculate the tfidf weights of doc: tfidf_weights

# Print the first five weights
print(tfidf_weights[:5])

# Create a new TfidfModel using the corpus: tfidf
tfidf = TfidfModel(corpus)

##### Charting practice {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise, you'll use some extracted named entities and their groupings from a series of newspaper articles to chart the diversity of named entity types in the articles.</p>
<p>You'll use a <code>defaultdict</code> called <code>ner_categories</code>, with keys representing every named entity group type, and values to count the number of each different named entity type. You have a chunked sentence list called <code>chunked_sentences</code> similar to the last exercise, but this time with non-binary category names.</p>
<p>You can use <code>hasattr()</code> to determine if each chunk has a <code>'label'</code> and then simply use the chunk's <code>.label()</code> method as the dictionary key.</p>

<li>In the inner <code>for</code> loop, iterate over <code>sent</code>. If the condition is true, increment the value of each key by 1. </li>
<li><em>Remember to use the chunk's <code>.label()</code> method as the key!</em></li></ul></li>
<li>For the pie chart labels, create a list called <code>labels</code> from the keys of <code>ner_categories</code>, which can be accessed using <code>.keys()</code>.</li>

<div class="exercise--instructions__content"><ul>
<li>Use a list comprehension to create a list called <code>values</code>, using the <code>.get()</code> method on <code>ner_categories</code> to compute the values of each label <code>v</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>plt.pie()</code> to create a pie chart for each of the NER categories. Along with <code>values</code> and <code>labels=labels</code>, pass the extra keyword arguments <code>autopct='%1.1f%%'</code> and <code>startangle=140</code> to add percentages to the chart and rotate the initial start angle. <ul>

#### Multilingual with polyglot {.unnumbered}



##### French NER with polyglot I {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>In this exercise and the next, you'll use the <code>polyglot</code> library to identify French entities. The library functions slightly differently than <code>spacy</code>, so you'll use a few of the new things you learned in the last video to display the named entity text and category.</p>

</div>


<li>Use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples called <code>entities</code>. </li>
<li>The output expression of your list comprehension should be a tuple.
<li>The first element of each tuple is the entity tag, which you can access using its <code>.tag</code> attribute.</li>
<li>The second element is the full string of the entity text, which you can access using <code>.join(ent)</code>.</li>

<div class>
<p>You'll continue your exploration of <code>polyglot</code> now with some Spanish annotation. This article is not written by a newspaper, so it is your first example of a more blog-like text. How do you think that might compare when finding entities?</p>
<p>The <code>Text</code> object has been created as <code>txt</code>, and each entity has been printed, as you can see in the IPython Shell. </p>
<p>Your specific task is to determine how many of the entities contain the words <code>"Márquez"</code> or <code>"Gabo"</code> - these refer to the same person in different ways!</p>
</div>


<li>Iterate over all of the entities of <code>txt</code>, using <code>ent</code> as your iterator variable.</li>
<li>Check whether the entity contains <code>"Márquez"</code> or <code>"Gabo"</code>. If it does, increment <code>count</code>. <em>Don't forget to include the accented <code>á</code> in <code>"Márquez"</code>!</em>
</li>
<li>Hit 'Submit Answer' to see what percentage of entities refer to Gabriel García Márquez (aka Gabo).</li>

### Fake news classifier {.unnumbered}

<p class="chapter__description">
    You'll apply the basics of what you've learned along with some supervised machine learning to build a "fake news" detector. You'll begin by learning the basics of supervised machine learning, and then move forward by choosing a few important features and testing ideas to identify and classify fake news articles.

#### Word count vectors {.unnumbered}



##### CountVectorizer for text classification {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>It's time to begin building your text classifier! The <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_3629/fake_or_real_news.csv">data</a> has been loaded into a DataFrame called <code>df</code>. Explore it in the IPython Shell to investigate what columns you can use. The <code>.head()</code> method is particularly informative.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you'll use <code>pandas</code> alongside scikit-learn to create a sparse text vectorizer you can use to train and test a simple supervised model. To begin, you'll set up a <code>CountVectorizer</code> and investigate some of its features.</p>
</div>



<li>Import <code>CountVectorizer</code> from <code>sklearn.feature_extraction.text</code> and <code>train_test_split</code> from <code>sklearn.model_selection</code>.</li>
<li>Create a Series <code>y</code> to use for the labels by assigning the <code>.label</code> attribute of <code>df</code> to <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>df["text"]</code> (features) and <code>y</code> (labels), create training and test sets using <code>train_test_split()</code>. Use a <code>test_size</code> of <code>0.33</code> and a <code>random_state</code> of <code>53</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>CountVectorizer</code> object called <code>count_vectorizer</code>. Ensure you specify the keyword argument <code>stop_words="english"</code> so that stop words are removed.</li>
<li>Fit and transform the training data <code>X_train</code> using the <code>.fit_transform()</code> method of your <code>CountVectorizer</code> object. Do the same with the test data <code>X_test</code>, except using the <code>.transform()</code> method.</li>
<li>Print the first 10 features of the <code>count_vectorizer</code> using its <code>.get_feature_names()</code> method.</li>
```{python}

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Print the head of df
print(df.head())

# Create a series to store the labels: y
y = df.label

# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['text'], y, test_size=0.33, random_state=53)

# Initialize a CountVectorizer object: count_vectorizer
count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Transform the training data using only the 'text' column values: count_train 
count_train = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the test data using only the 'text' column values: count_test 
count_test = count_vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Print the first 10 features of the count_vectorizer
print(count_vectorizer.get_feature_names()[:10])
```

<p class="">Great work!</p>

##### TfidfVectorizer for text classification {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Similar to the sparse <code>CountVectorizer</code> created in the previous exercise, you'll work on creating tf-idf vectors for your documents. You'll set up a <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> and investigate some of its features.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you'll use <code>pandas</code> and <code>sklearn</code> along with the same <code>X_train</code>, <code>y_train</code> and <code>X_test</code>, <code>y_test</code> DataFrames and Series you created in the last exercise.</p>
</div>


<li>Import <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> from <code>sklearn.feature_extraction.text</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> object called <code>tfidf_vectorizer</code>. When doing so, specify the keyword arguments <code>stop_words="english"</code> and <code>max_df=0.7</code>.</li>
<li>Fit and transform the training data. </li>
<li>Transform the test data.</li>
<li>Print the first 10 features of <code>tfidf_vectorizer</code>.</li>
<li>Print the first 5 vectors of the tfidf training data using slicing on the <code>.A</code> (or array) <strong><em>attribute</em></strong> of <code>tfidf_train</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import TfidfVectorizer

# Initialize a TfidfVectorizer object: tfidf_vectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_df=0.7)

# Transform the training data: tfidf_train 
tfidf_train = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)

tfidf_test = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Print the first 10 features
print(tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names()[:10])

# Print the first 5 vectors of the tfidf training data
print(tfidf_train.A[:5])
```

<p class="">Great work!</p>

##### Inspecting the vectors {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>To get a better idea of how the vectors work, you'll investigate them by converting them into <code>pandas</code> DataFrames.</p>
<p>Here, you'll use the same data structures you created in the previous two exercises (<code>count_train</code>, <code>count_vectorizer</code>, <code>tfidf_train</code>, <code>tfidf_vectorizer</code>) as well as <code>pandas</code>, which is imported as <code>pd</code>.</p>
</div>


<li>Create the DataFrames <code>count_df</code> and <code>tfidf_df</code> by using <code>pd.DataFrame()</code> and specifying the values as the first argument and the columns (or features) as the second argument.
<li>The values can be accessed by using the <code>.A</code> attribute of, respectively, <code>count_train</code> and <code>tfidf_train</code>.</li>
<li>The columns can be accessed using the <code>.get_feature_names()</code> methods of <code>count_vectorizer</code> and <code>tfidf_vectorizer</code>.</li>

</li>
<li>Print the head of each DataFrame to investigate their structure. <em>This has been done for you.</em>
</li>
<li>Test if the column names are the same for each DataFrame by creating a new object called <code>difference</code> to see the difference between the columns that <code>count_df</code> has from <code>tfidf_df</code>. Columns can be accessed using the <code>.columns</code> attribute of a DataFrame. Subtract the set of <code>tfidf_df.columns</code> from the set of <code>count_df.columns</code>.</li>
<li>Test if the two DataFrames are equivalent by using the <code>.equals()</code> method on <code>count_df</code> with <code>tfidf_df</code> as the argument.</li>
```{python}
# Create the CountVectorizer DataFrame: count_df
count_df = pd.DataFrame(count_train.A, columns=count_vectorizer.get_feature_names())

##### Training and testing the &quot;fake news&quot; model with CountVectorizer {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now it's your turn to train the "fake news" model using the features you identified and extracted. In this first exercise you'll train and test a Naive Bayes model using the <code>CountVectorizer</code> data.</p>
<p>The training and test sets have been created, and <code>count_vectorizer</code>, <code>count_train</code>, and <code>count_test</code> have been computed.</p>
</div>


<li>Import the <code>metrics</code> module from <code>sklearn</code> and <code>MultinomialNB</code> from <code>sklearn.naive_bayes</code>.</li>
<li>Instantiate a <code>MultinomialNB</code> classifier called <code>nb_classifier</code>.</li>
<li>Fit the classifier to the training data.</li>
<li>Compute the predicted tags for the test data.</li>
<li>Calculate and print the accuracy score of the classifier.</li>
<li>Compute the confusion matrix. To make it easier to read, specify the keyword argument <code>labels=['FAKE', 'REAL']</code>.</li>
```{python}
# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn import metrics

# Instantiate a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier: nb_classifier
nb_classifier = MultinomialNB()

# Fit the classifier to the training data
nb_classifier.fit(count_train, y_train)

# Create the predicted tags: pred
pred = nb_classifier.predict(count_test)

# Calculate the accuracy score: score
score = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, pred)
print(score)

# Calculate the confusion matrix: cm
cm = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, pred, labels=['FAKE', 'REAL'])
print(cm)

##### Improving the model {.unnumbered}

<div class=""><p>What are possible next steps you could take to improve the model?</p></div>

- [ ] Tweaking alpha levels.
- [ ] Trying a new classification model.
- [ ] Training on a larger dataset.
- [ ] Improving text preprocessing.
- [x] All of the above.

<p class="dc-completion-pane__message dc-u-maxw-100pc">Indeed!</p>

##### Improving your model {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Your job in this exercise is to test a few different alpha levels using the <code>Tfidf</code> vectors to determine if there is a better performing combination.</p>
<p>The training and test sets have been created, and <code>tfidf_vectorizer</code>, <code>tfidf_train</code>, and <code>tfidf_test</code> have been computed.</p>
</div>



<li>Create a list of alphas to try using <code>np.arange()</code>. Values should range from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> with steps of <code>0.1</code>.</li>
<li>Create a function <code>train_and_predict()</code> that takes in one argument: <code>alpha</code>. The function should:
<li>Instantiate a <code>MultinomialNB</code> classifier with <code>alpha=alpha</code>.</li>
<li>Fit it to the training data.</li>
<li>Compute predictions on the test data.</li>
<li>Compute and return the accuracy score.</li>

</li>
<li>Using a <code>for</code> loop, print the <code>alpha</code>, <code>score</code> and a newline in between. Use your <code>train_and_predict()</code> function to compute the <code>score</code>. Does the score change along with the alpha? What is the best alpha?</li>
```{python}
# edited/added
import numpy as np

# Create the list of alphas: alphas
alphas = np.arange(0, 1, .1)

# Define train_and_predict()
def train_and_predict(alpha):
    # Instantiate the classifier: nb_classifier
    nb_classifier = MultinomialNB(alpha=alpha)
    # Fit to the training data
    nb_classifier.fit(tfidf_train, y_train)
    # Predict the labels: pred
    pred = nb_classifier.predict(tfidf_test)
    # Compute accuracy: score
    score = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, pred)
    return score

# Iterate over the alphas and print the corresponding score
for alpha in alphas:
    print('Alpha: ', alpha)
    print('Score: ', train_and_predict(alpha))
    print()
```

##### Inspecting your model {.unnumbered}


<div class>
<p>Now that you have built a "fake news" classifier, you'll investigate what it has learned. You can map the important vector weights back to actual words using some simple inspection techniques.</p>
<p>You have your well performing tfidf Naive Bayes classifier available as <code>nb_classifier</code>, and the vectors as <code>tfidf_vectorizer</code>.</p>
</div>



<li>Save the class labels as <code>class_labels</code> by accessing the <code>.classes_</code> attribute of <code>nb_classifier</code>.</li>
<li>Extract the features using the <code>.get_feature_names()</code> method of <code>tfidf_vectorizer</code>.</li>
<li>Create a zipped array of the classifier coefficients with the feature names and sort them by the coefficients. To do this, first use <code>zip()</code> with the arguments <code>nb_classifier.coef_[0]</code> and <code>feature_names</code>. Then, use <code>sorted()</code> on this.</li>
<li>Print the <em>top</em> 20 weighted features for the first label of <code>class_labels</code> and print the bottom 20 weighted features for the second label of <code>class_labels</code>. <em>This has been done for you.</em>
</li>
